              NEZHA: high performance GPU computation graph 
                     framework for ML and graphics workloads

# Directory structure:
- examples/ -> Examples. Each subdirectory compiles to an executable of that name
- ext/      -> Dependencies (other than Vulkan) - not all are in use right now
- nezha/    -> GPU computation graph framework (static library)
- res/      -> All compute kernels / shaders
- src/      -> The model we are working on

# Setup (other platforms to come):

- MacOS:
  Make sure you export brew's include and library paths in shell config for M1
  Install Vulkan SDK
  `brew install glfw`
  `brew install cmake`
  `brew install glm`
  `mkdir build`
  `cd build`
  `cmake ..`
  `make`
